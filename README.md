<strong>IRON PACMAN GAME VERSION 1.0</strong>

The classic Pacman Game adapted to coders life. Instead of white balls as food, and fruits as bonus, you got line codes and programming languages.

The game is made to play with 2 players, first the Player 1 and then Player 2, who makes more points wins.

You control the Pacman with the arrows of your keyboard. Gain points when you eat the code and the bonus.

When you are in bonus mode, the ghosts get into scared mode, and the run from you. If you catch them they dissapear until the bonus time ends. Each bonus times is 8 seconds long.

Good luck!!
